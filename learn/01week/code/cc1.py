# Read lines 5 and 6, which demonstrate declaring a variable named a and assigning to it a value with an integer data type, then printing its data type to the screen.

a = 1
print(type(a))

# On line 8, write code to declare a variable named b and assign to it any value of your choice with a float data type. Then on line 9, write code to print the variable b's data type to the screen.

b = 3.14
print(type(b))

# On line 11, declare a variable named c and assign to it any value of your choice with a string data type. Then also print its data type to the screen on line 12.

c = "spam"
print(type(c))

# On line 14, declare a variable named d and assign to it the value of a plus b. On line 15, print the value stored in the variable d to the screen. Note, you should print the actual value of d rather than its data type.

d = a + b
print(d)
